- [ ] Graph renders smoothly
- [ ] No memory leaks in long sessions

### Monitoring
- [ ] Set up Vercel Analytics (optional)
- [ ] Configured error tracking
- [ ] Checked deployment logs
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring (optional)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Deployment Errors

#### Build Fails
```
Error: No module named 'google.generativeai'
```
**Fix:** Ensure `google-generativeai` is in `requirements.txt`

#### Runtime Error
```
Error: GEMINI_API_KEY not set
```
**Fix:** Add environment variable in Vercel dashboard

#### Import Error
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fitz'
```
**Fix:** Ensure `PyMuPDF` is in `requirements.txt`

#### Function Timeout
```
Error: Function execution timed out
```
**Fix:** Optimize PDF processing or increase timeout in `vercel.json`

### Verification Commands

Check deployment status:
```bash
vercel list
```

View logs:
```bash
vercel logs [deployment-url]
```

Check environment variables:
```bash
vercel env ls
```

Remove deployment:
```bash
vercel remove [deployment-name]
```

## Domain Configuration (Optional)

### Custom Domain
- [ ] Purchased domain
- [ ] Added domain in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Configured DNS records
- [ ] SSL certificate issued
- [ ] Domain accessible via HTTPS

### Subdomain
- [ ] Created subdomain
- [ ] Added to Vercel project
- [ ] DNS propagated
- [ ] Tested subdomain access

## Security Review

### Pre-Launch Security
- [ ] No API keys in source code
- [ ] `.env` file in `.gitignore`
- [ ] HTTPS enabled (automatic on Vercel)
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] File upload size limits set
- [ ] Rate limiting considered

### Post-Launch Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor for unusual API usage
- [ ] Check for errors in logs
- [ ] Watch for abuse patterns
- [ ] Set up alerts for high usage

## Performance Optimization

### Vercel Configuration
- [ ] Enabled Edge Network
- [ ] Configured caching headers
- [ ] Set appropriate timeout values
- [ ] Optimized function size

### Code Optimization

- [ ] Contribution guidelines (if open source)

## Rollback Plan

### If Deployment Fails
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Review error messages
3. Test locally to reproduce
4. Fix issues and redeploy
5. If critical, rollback to previous deployment:
   ```bash
   vercel rollback [previous-deployment-url]
   ```
